# ISO 27001 Certification Guide

## Overview

ISO/IEC 27001 is the international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive information through risk management processes.

### Why ISO 27001 Matters for ZeroShare

- **Global recognition**: Accepted worldwide, unlike region-specific standards
- **Government contracts**: Often required for government/public sector sales
- **Framework approach**: Provides structure for all security activities
- **Synergy with SOC 2**: Significant overlap allows dual certification efficiency

### ISO 27001 vs SOC 2

| Aspect | ISO 27001 | SOC 2 |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Scope | Organization-wide ISMS | Specific service/system |
| Geography | International | Primarily US |
| Approach | Risk-based | Control-based |
| Certification | Yes (certificate issued) | No (report issued) |
| Validity | 3 years + annual surveillance | Annual |

**Recommendation**: Pursue both, as 60-70% of controls overlap.

## Application Process

### Step 1: Gap Analysis (Weeks 1-4)

**Actions:**
1. Review ISO 27001 requirements against current state
2. Assess all 93 Annex A controls
3. Document gaps and remediation needs
4. Estimate effort and resources

**Deliverables:**
- Gap analysis report
- Remediation roadmap
- Resource plan

**Tips:**
- Use ISO 27001 gap assessment templates
- Consider hiring a consultant for initial assessment
- Be honest about gaps - better to find them now

### Step 2: Establish ISMS (Weeks 5-12)

**2.1 Define Scope**
```
Example Scope Statement:
"The Information Security Management System covers the development, 
deployment, and operation of the ZeroShare Gateway product, including 
all supporting infrastructure, personnel, and third-party services 
involved in delivering the service to customers."
```

**2.2 Create Core Documentation**

| Document | Purpose | Template Location |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Information Security Policy | Top-level commitment | templates/security-policy.md |
| Risk Assessment Methodology | How risks are assessed | templates/risk-methodology.md |
| Statement of Applicability | Which controls apply | templates/soa-template.xlsx |

**2.3 Conduct Risk Assessment**

1. Identify information assets
2. Identify threats and vulnerabilities
3. Assess likelihood and impact
4. Calculate risk scores
5. Determine treatment options

**Risk Treatment Options:**
- **Mitigate**: Implement controls
- **Transfer**: Insurance, outsourcing
- **Accept**: Document acceptance
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk source

### Step 3: Implement Controls (Weeks 13-28)

Prioritize controls based on:
1. Risk level (highest first)
2. Quick wins (easy implementations)
3. Dependencies (foundational controls first)

**Implementation Order Recommendation:**

```
Phase 1 (Foundation):
- A.5.1 Policies for information security
- A.5.2 Information security roles
- A.5.15 Access control
- A.8.9 Configuration management

Phase 2 (Technical):
- A.8.5 Secure authentication
- A.8.7 Protection against malware
- A.8.15-16 Logging and monitoring
- A.8.24 Use of cryptography

Phase 3 (Operational):
- A.5.23 Supplier relationships
- A.5.24 Incident management
- A.5.29 Business continuity
- A.6.3 Awareness and training
```

### Step 4: Operate ISMS (Weeks 29-40)

**Minimum Operating Period:** 3 months recommended before certification audit

**During Operation:**
- Collect evidence of control operation
- Conduct internal audits
- Hold management reviews
- Address nonconformities
- Refine processes based on experience

### Step 5: Select Certification Body (Weeks 28-32)

**Accredited Certification Bodies:**

| Certification Body | Reputation | Cost Range |
|-------------------|------------|------------|
| BSI | Premium, well-known | $15K-$30K |
| DNV | Strong technical focus | $12K-$25K |
| Bureau Veritas | Global presence | $12K-$25K |
| TÜV | German engineering rigor | $15K-$30K |
| Schellman | US-based, tech-focused | $10K-$20K |
| A-LIGN | Combined SOC 2/ISO | $12K-$25K |

**Selection Criteria:**
- ANAB or UKAS accreditation (required)
- Experience with technology companies
- Auditor availability
- Combined audit options (SOC 2 + ISO)

### Step 6: Stage 1 Audit (Weeks 41-42)

**Purpose:** Documentation review and readiness assessment

**What Auditors Review:**
- ISMS documentation completeness
- Scope appropriateness
- Risk assessment methodology
- Statement of Applicability
- Internal audit results
- Management review records

**Outcome:**
- Readiness confirmation or
- List of issues to address before Stage 2

**Timeline:** 1-2 days on-site or remote

### Step 7: Stage 2 Audit (Weeks 45-48)

**Purpose:** Verify controls are implemented and effective

**What Auditors Do:**
- Interview personnel
- Observe processes
- Review evidence
- Test controls
- Verify documentation matches practice

**Audit Duration:** 3-5 days (depends on scope size)

**Possible Findings:**
- **Major nonconformity**: Significant gap, must fix before certification
- **Minor nonconformity**: Issue exists but contained, fix within timeframe
- **Observation**: Improvement opportunity, not required to fix

### Step 8: Certification Decision (Weeks 49-50)

After successful Stage 2:
1. Auditor submits report to certification body
2. Technical reviewer evaluates report
3. Certification decision made
4. Certificate issued (valid 3 years)
