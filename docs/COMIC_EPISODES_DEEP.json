        "description": "Normal Thursday morning. The office looks exactly like Episode 1. Marcus pastes something into ChatGPT - it gets blocked. He shrugs, doesn't question it anymore. Lisa's AI responses come back sanitized - she smiles at the 'helpful' output. Tom's campaign generates clean. Everyone works happily, productively, safely.",

They're in their usual spots, doing their usual things. The Gateway dashboard glows steadily: 'ALL SYSTEMS NOMINAL'. The block counter is now over 10 million.",

        "description": "Final panel. Wide shot of the entire office. Everyone working, living their lives, using AI safely without knowing they're being protected. In the corner, Alex and Jordan at their desks - small figures in a big office, doing the work that keeps everyone safe. For the first time in 34 episodes, they both smile. Small smiles. Knowing smiles.",
        "dialogue": "Jordan (small text, smiling): 'It's always Thursday.'\nAlex (matching small smile): 'Always.'",
        "hiddenElements": "Bottom corner text: 'Gateway Active. Protecting: All.' The final easter egg: if you look at every Episode 1 panel again, the protection was ALWAYS visible. You just didn't know what to look for."
