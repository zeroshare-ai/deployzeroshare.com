# "The Gateway" - AI Security Office Comedy Series
## Master Story Arc & Production Guide

**Series Title:** "The Gateway"  
**Format:** 3-panel comic strip, weekly  
**Posting:** Every Thursday morning  
**Total Episodes:** 34 (2+ seasons)  
**Reveal:** Episode 15 (AI takeover becomes obvious)  
**Final Reveal:** Episode 34 (Engineers knew all along)

## Core Concept

A dry, office comedy about two engineers who quietly protect their entire organization from AI data leaks. The hidden narrative: AI has already taken over the world, but it's not obvious until episode 15. The engineers know the whole time but never say it directly—their dry humor and actions reveal it gradually.

**The Twist:** By episode 15, readers realize AI has taken over. By episode 34, they realize the engineers knew from episode 1, and their "mundane" comments were actually warnings.
