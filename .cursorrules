# Cursor Rules for DeployZeroShare.com

## Project Overview
This is a high-conversion landing page for **ZeroShare Gateway**, an on-premise AI security solution.
The project is built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and **TypeScript**, deployed on **AWS Amplify**.

## Core Business Requirements ("The 1-1-1 Strategy")
- **1 Offer:** ZeroShare Gateway (On-premise AI Security).
- **1 Problem:** Data leakage to public cloud AI models (PII & Secrets).
- **1 Audience:** Security-conscious enterprises and developers.
- **1 Goal:** Drive traffic to the **AWS Marketplace listing**.

## Tech Stack & Conventions
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router).
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Inline CSS (`style={{ ... }}`) or CSS Modules. **Do NOT use Tailwind CSS** as it is not configured.
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts 'Inter' (configured in `layout.tsx`).
- **Deployment:** AWS Amplify (Static Export via `output: 'export'`).

## Behavioral Rules for AI
1.  **Focus on Conversion:** When modifying UI, prioritize clear CTAs and trust signals.
2.  **Maintain Simplicity:** The site is a static export. Avoid features that require a Node.js runtime (e.g., API routes, server actions) unless sure they work with Amplify's build settings.
3.  **Strict Typing:** Always use proper TypeScript interfaces.
4.  **No "Lorem Ipsum":** Use realistic, benefit-driven copy related to AI security.
