Visibility before policy\n   You can't govern what you can't see.\n\n2. Enable, don't block\n   Prohibition creates shadow IT. Enablement creates adoption.\n\n3. Technical controls over training\n   Humans make mistakes. Systems catch them.\n\nThe organizations that figure this out first will have a significant advantage—not just in security, but in productivity.\n\n#AIGovernance #CISO #Leadership",
