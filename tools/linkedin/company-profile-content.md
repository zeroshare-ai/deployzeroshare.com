Stop AI Data Leaks Before They Start | Enable ChatGPT, Copilot & Claude Safely

```
Your employees are using AI. The question is: do you have visibility?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE PROBLEM

65% of employees have shared sensitive data with ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude—without authorization.

Every prompt is a potential breach:
• Customer SSNs pasted into support chats
• API keys shared in code reviews
• Medical records summarized for reports
• Financial data analyzed for trends

Once it's sent, it's in their training data. Forever.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
