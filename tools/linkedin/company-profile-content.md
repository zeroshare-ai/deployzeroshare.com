Stop Data Leaks Before They Reach AI | On-Premise Security Gateway

## About / Description (2000 characters max)

```
ZeroShare Gateway is the enterprise security layer for AI adoption.

THE PROBLEM
Your employees are using ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and other AI tools—whether you've approved them or not. Every prompt is a potential data leak.

Research shows:
• 22% of files uploaded to AI tools contain sensitive data
• 65% of employees have shared sensitive data with AI without authorization
• $4.45M average cost of a data breach (IBM 2023)

THE SOLUTION
ZeroShare Gateway deploys on-premise as a transparent proxy between your users and AI services. It automatically:

✓ Detects PII (emails, SSNs, credit cards, health data)
✓ Blocks secrets (API keys, credentials, connection strings)
✓ Logs everything for compliance audits
✓ Works with ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, Claude & more

No code changes. Deploy in minutes. Sub-millisecond latency.

COMPLIANCE READY
• SOC 2 Type II aligned
• HIPAA compliant
• GDPR ready
• Complete audit logging
