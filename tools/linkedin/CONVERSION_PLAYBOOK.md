# Conversion Playbook – Brand, Trust, and Paid Customers

**Mission:** Every post drives toward AWS Marketplace sign-ups and paid conversion. Free users become paid users; we build brand, trust, and loyalty so that over time we’re the default choice for AI security.

---

## 1. North Star

- **Primary:** Conversions to AWS Marketplace (free trial → paid).
- **Secondary:** Brand recognition, trust, and “we’re the experts” positioning.
- **Tone:** Authority + humor. Serious where it matters, light where it helps. Never mean or fear‑mongering.

---

## 2. Psychology Principles (Use Responsibly)

We use evidence-based influence **without** deception. All claims stay accurate; we’re just clear and persuasive.

| Principle | Use in content |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Authority** | Cite data (IBM, regulators), “CISOs we work with,” “auditors ask for X.” Position ZeroShare as the expert solution. |
| **Social proof** | Stats (“65% have shared data”), “orgs doing this well,” “high‑performing CISOs,” case-style stories. |
| **Reciprocity** | Free value first: guides, templates, clear explanations. Then soft CTAs (docs, trial, pricing). |
| **Commitment & consistency** | Small yeses first: “Follow us,” “Read this,” “Try free tier.” Then “Upgrade when you’re ready.” |
| **Scarcity / loss aversion** | “Board will ask,” “audit is coming,” “one incident = $4.45M.” Urgency, not manipulation. |
| **Identity** | “You’re the kind of leader who enables AI safely,” “Engineers who care about secrets.” Appeal to how they see themselves. |

## 3. Content Arc: Awareness → Need → Consideration → Trial → Paid

- **Awareness:** “AI data leakage is real” – stats, stories, regulation.
- **Need:** “Your org has this gap” – shadow AI, auditors, board, productivity vs. risk.
- **Consideration:** “Technical controls exist” – how gateways work, what “enable safely” means.
- **Trial:** “Try free” – low friction, clear next step.
- **Paid:** “Upgrade when it’s working” – ROI, team size, compliance.

Not every post does all five. Each post should move people at least one step.

## 4. Humor + Trust

- **Humor:** Witty one-liners, light sarcasm, relatable “war stories.” Keeps feed human and shareable.
- **Trust:** No hype, no fake claims. Admit trade-offs, link to docs, use precise numbers and sources.
- **Mix:** Some posts are mostly humor + hook; others are mostly education or authority. Balance both.

---

## 5. LinkedIn ↔ X (Twitter) Matching

- **Same narrative:** LinkedIn post and X post convey the same message and CTA. X = shortened, same intent.
- **Crosslink both ways:**
  - LinkedIn: “Follow us on X → @DeployZeroShare” (or link).
  - X: “Also on LinkedIn → [company page].”
- **Conversion URLs everywhere:** Use UTMs on every link (`utm_source=linkedin` | `twitter`, `utm_medium=social`, `utm_campaign=...`). Prefer `/pricing` or marketplace when the CTA is “try” or “buy.”

---

## 6. Conversion URL Hierarchy

1. **“Try / buy” CTA** → `deployzeroshare.com/pricing` or AWS Marketplace (with UTMs).
2. **“See how it works”** → `deployzeroshare.com/docs`.
3. **“Compliance / audit”** → `deployzeroshare.com/compliance`.
4. **“Learn more” / general** → `deployzeroshare.com` or relevant blog/resource.

Always append UTM params for attribution.

---

## 7. What “Match” Means (LinkedIn vs X)

- **Match = same story, same CTA, same conversion goal.**
- LinkedIn: full post, bullets, links, hashtags.
- X: shortened hook + same CTA link + crosslink to LinkedIn when possible.
- Tracking: cross‑post by `linkedinPostId` so we know which X post pairs with which LinkedIn post.

---

## 8. Don’ts

- No fake statistics or fake case studies.
- No “we’re compliant” unless we actually are (see .cursorrules).
- No dunking on competitors by name.
- No bait-and-switch (“free” that isn’t, or hidden pricing).

Use psychology to **clarify** value and **reduce friction**, not to trick people.
