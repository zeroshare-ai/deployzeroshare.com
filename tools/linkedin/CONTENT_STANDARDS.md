- [ ] Layman's terms are used WITHOUT sacrificing accuracy
- [ ] No oversimplification that creates misunderstanding
- [ ] API behaviors, data flows, and security mechanisms are correct
- [ ] If a story is fictional, the TECHNOLOGY described must be real

**Examples:**
- ✅ "ChatGPT retains conversations for 30 days by default" (verifiable)
- ✅ "API keys in prompts can end up in training data" (technically accurate)
- ❌ "ChatGPT stores everything forever" (oversimplified, incorrect)
- ❌ "AI can read your mind" (sensationalized, wrong)

### 2. Viral Potential (Score 7+/10 required)

- [ ] Snarky but not mean
- [ ] Confident but not arrogant
- [ ] Educational but not preachy
- [ ] Urgent but not fear-mongering
- [ ] Targets: CISOs, Compliance Managers, Security Leaders, Engineering Managers

### 4. Source Verification
