They're just:\n- Pasting customer emails for help drafting responses\n- Sharing code snippets (with credentials) for debugging\n- Uploading documents for summarization\n\nThe AI doesn't feel like a data risk. But it is.\n\nWe put together a 5-minute read on the most common ways data leaks to AI:\n\n→ https://deployzeroshare.com/blog/prevent-pii-leaks-ai-chatbots?utm_source=email&utm_medium=nurture&utm_campaign=day_3\n\nStay secure,\nThe ZeroShare Team\n\nP.S.

It:\n\n✓ Detects PII in prompts (SSNs, emails, credit cards)\n✓ Blocks secrets (API keys, credentials)\n✓ Logs everything for compliance\n✓ Works with ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude\n\nYour employees use AI normally. Your data stays protected.\n\nSee how it works in 2 minutes:\n\n→ https://deployzeroshare.com/docs?utm_source=email&utm_medium=nurture&utm_campaign=day_7\n\nQuestions?
