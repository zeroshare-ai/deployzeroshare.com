**Why This Combination:**
- ✅ **COMPUTER_SOFTWARE**: Required - ZeroShare Gateway is enterprise security software
- ✅ **GOVERNMENT_EDUCATION_PUBLIC_SERVICES**: Your product helps with compliance (GDPR, SOC 2) which is critical for public sector/government customers. AWS GSCA program specifically focuses on Public Sector for security/compliance.
