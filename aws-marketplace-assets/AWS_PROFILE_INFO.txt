SHORT DESCRIPTION
-----------------
Stop AI Data Leaks Before They Start. Enable ChatGPT & Copilot Safely.

FULL COMPANY DESCRIPTION
------------------------
Your employees are using AI. The question is: do you have visibility?

THE PROBLEM
65% of employees have shared sensitive data with ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude—without authorization. Every prompt is a potential breach: customer SSNs pasted into support chats, API keys shared in code reviews, and financial data analyzed for trends. Once it's sent, it's in their training data forever.

THE SOLUTION
ZeroShare Gateway is the security layer between your employees and AI. We deploy on-premise so you maintain complete control.

• Automatic PII Detection: Redacts 50+ patterns (SSNs, emails, phones) before they leave your network.
• Secrets Blocking: Instantly blocks API keys and credentials from leaking into code assistants.
• Compliance Ready: Full audit logging for SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR.
• Low Latency: Sub-5ms processing ensures users won't notice the security layer.

Deploy on-premise. Maintain control. Enable productivity without risk.
