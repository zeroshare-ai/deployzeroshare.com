# Project Context & Deploy Discipline

## 1. Read First

**Before substantive work on deployzeroshare.com**, read (in order):

1. **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** – Strategy, offer, problem, audience, implementation.
2. **STATUS.md** – What’s live, what’s pending, URLs, analytics, testing status.
3. **.cursor/rules/release-discipline.mdc** – Cascade (PRD → Code → Tests → Docs → Marketing → Deploy), agent instructions, pre-release checklist.

Also respect **.cursorrules** (always applied): tech stack, compliance claims, cross-project context, content standards.

## 2. Deploy Verify & Report

**When changing anything that affects production** (e.g. `amplify.yml`, `app/`, `next.config.js`, `public/`, rewrites, env):

1. **State that a redeploy is needed** – e.g. “Push to `main` triggers Amplify; redeploy required.”
2. **Point to verification** – `deploy-amplify.yml` runs on push (waits ~90s, then smoke + links + deployment tests). Manual: run **Verify Deployment** workflow or `npm run test:smoke` / `npm run test:deployed` against `https://deployzeroshare.com`.
3. **Report back** – After deploy is live, either:
   - Run `npm run test:smoke` and `npm run test:deployed` (or `npm run test:links` as needed) and summarize results (pass/fail, any failures), or
   - Summarize what to check and what “success” looks like, and offer to run verification once the user confirms deploy is complete.

Do not skip verification or reporting when the change affects production.
