# The $4.45M Gamble Your Board Doesn't Know About

**A Board-Ready Presentation on AI Security Risk**

> Every prompt is a potential breach. Is your board aware?

---

## The Board Question

At your next board meeting, someone will ask:

"What is our exposure from employee AI usage?"

This whitepaper gives you the answer - with data, frameworks, and recommendations your board will understand.

## Quantifying the Risk

**Direct costs:**
- Average data breach: $4.45M (IBM, 2023)
- AI-related breaches: 23% higher than average
- Regulatory fines: Up to 4% of global revenue (GDPR)

**Indirect costs:**
- Customer churn from breach: 3.4% average
- Stock price impact: -7.5% average (public companies)
- Executive liability: Personal fines and termination

**Probability:**
- 65% of employees have shared sensitive data with AI
- Without controls, a breach is not "if" but "when"

## The Business Case for AI Security

**Investment:** $50K-200K/year for AI security gateway

**Risk reduction:**
- 99%+ of sensitive data blocked before reaching AI
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- Real-time visibility into AI usage

**ROI calculation:**
- Prevent ONE breach: $4.45M saved
- Annual investment: $100K
- ROI: 4,350%

Even at 1% probability of preventing a breach, the investment pays for itself 43x over.

## Recommended Board Motion

"The Board authorizes management to implement AI security controls including:
1. Deployment of AI security gateway technology
2. Development of AI acceptable use policy
3. Quarterly reporting on AI security metrics
4. Budget allocation of $[X] for AI security program"

This motion demonstrates fiduciary responsibility and positions the company ahead of regulatory requirements.
