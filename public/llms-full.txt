# ZeroShare Gateway - Extended LLMs Context

===============================================================================
PRODUCT OVERVIEW
===============================================================================

ZeroShare Gateway is an enterprise-grade AI security gateway designed to prevent 
sensitive data leakage when organizations use external AI services like ChatGPT, 
GitHub Copilot, Claude, and other generative AI tools.

The core problem ZeroShare solves: Organizations want to leverage AI productivity 
tools but face significant risks of accidentally exposing PII (Personally 
Identifiable Information), secrets (API keys, credentials), and confidential 
business data to external AI providers.

ZeroShare Gateway works as a transparent proxy that inspects all traffic to AI 
services, detecting and optionally redacting sensitive data before it leaves 
the organization's network.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
===============================================================================

Deployment Models:
1. On-Premise: Docker containers or Kubernetes deployment
2. Private Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP with customer-controlled infrastructure
3. AWS Marketplace: One-click deployment on AWS

Architecture:
- Transparent HTTP/HTTPS proxy
- Supports MITM inspection with custom CA certificates
- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Redis-based session management (optional)
- PostgreSQL or DynamoDB for audit logs

Performance:
- Average latency overhead: <5ms
- 99.9% uptime SLA (Enterprise)
- Horizontal scaling to 100k+ requests/second
- Zero data retention on proxy (pass-through only)

===============================================================================

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
===============================================================================

Q: Does ZeroShare Gateway slow down AI responses?
A: Minimal impact. Average latency overhead is <5ms. The gateway uses streaming 
   pass-through so users see AI responses in real-time.

Q: Can ZeroShare Gateway work with on-premise AI models?
A: Yes. ZeroShare can be configured to inspect traffic to any HTTP/HTTPS endpoint, 
   including self-hosted LLMs like Llama, Mistral, or private ChatGPT deployments.

Q: What happens when sensitive data is detected?
A: Configurable actions include: block request, redact sensitive data, alert 
   security team, log for audit, or allow with warning.

Q: Is the gateway a single point of failure?
A: No. ZeroShare is designed for high availability with active-active clustering. 
   The Enterprise tier includes 99.9% uptime SLA.

Q: Can users bypass the gateway?
A: When properly deployed with network controls (firewall rules, PAC files), 
   bypass is not possible. Enterprise includes bypass detection alerting.

Q: Does ZeroShare store or read the data it inspects?
A: No. ZeroShare is a pass-through proxy. Data is inspected in memory only and 
   never stored. Only metadata (blocked/allowed, detection type) is logged.
