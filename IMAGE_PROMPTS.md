## Notes for Generation

1. **Consistency is key** - All images should feel like they came from the same design system
2. **No text in images** - Text will be overlaid in code for accessibility and editability  
3. **High resolution** - Generate at 2x if possible for retina displays
4. **Transparency** - Icons and overlays need transparent backgrounds
5. **Color accuracy** - Use the exact hex codes in the color palette for brand consistency
